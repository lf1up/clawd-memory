# 2026-02-16

## Infrastructure / Reliability
- Discord delivery issue investigated; gateway health looked OK but inbound DM delivery was inconsistent.
- Restarted OpenClaw gateway (`openclaw gateway restart`); Discord DM flow recovered after restart.

## Automation / Reminders
- Daily backup cron was upgraded from reminder-only to automatic execution + user notification.
- Cron job `claudius:daily-backup-auto` now runs at 21:00 Asia/Tbilisi in isolated mode, performs `git add/commit/push` when changes exist, and announces result.

## OpenClaw Runtime
- Updated OpenClaw to beta channel build via npm global install path.
- Version now confirmed as `2026.2.14` (beta channel) and gateway restarted successfully afterward.

## Persona & Skill System Expansion
- Installed Vercel Labs skills set (react best practices, composition patterns, react native, web design guidelines).
- Installed ClawHub skills for ops/dev domains: `kubernetes`, `aws-infra`, `devops`.
- Installed ClawHub frontend/testing/general capability skills: `react-best-practices`, `nextjs-expert`, `react-modernization`, `testing-patterns`, `e2e-testing-patterns`, `openclaw-mcp-plugin`, `openclaw-github-assistant`, `todoist`, `automation-workflows`, `playwright-browser-automation`.

## Persona Files Added
- Added frontend persona + template (`personas/frontend.md`, `personas/frontend-task-template.md`).
- Added backend persona + template (`personas/backend.md`, `personas/backend-task-template.md`).
- Added devops persona + template (`personas/devops.md`, `personas/devops-task-template.md`).
- Added testing persona + template (`personas/testing.md`, `personas/testing-task-template.md`).
- Added general ops persona + template (`personas/general-ops.md`, `personas/general-ops-task-template.md`).

## Tooling Readiness Check
- Playwright runtime is installed and Chromium browser binaries are present.
- Todoist CLI is installed, but Todoist auth token is not configured yet.
- GitHub assistant skill installed, but GitHub token/username are not configured yet.
- MCP plugin installed, but MCP server entries are not configured yet.

## Follow-up Decisions / User Preferences
- Pavel asked to defer MCP and GitHub credentials for now; keep skills installed but do not continue credential setup unless asked.

## Backup & Snapshot
- On request, performed immediate full workspace backup to GitHub (`origin` = `https://github.com/lf1up/clawd-memory.git`).
- Created setup snapshot file: `snapshots/setup-2026-02-16.md`.
- Backup commit pushed: `9d4096a` (`chore(backup): snapshot personas, skills, and memory for 2026-02-16`).

## Persona Dependency Documentation
- Added explicit dependency/prerequisite sections to persona docs (frontend, backend, devops, testing).
- Added centralized matrix: `personas/DEPENDENCIES.md` with skills, binaries, optional credentials, and current readiness status.
- Commit created: `a1a1884` (`docs(personas): add per-persona dependency requirements and matrix`).
