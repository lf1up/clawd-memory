# 2026-02-13

## Bootstrap
- 05:23 — First boot. Pavel woke me up via webchat.
- Name chosen: Claw 🦞
- Vibe: calm, direct, dry wit
- Pavel is in Tbilisi, GMT+4

## Security Scan
- 05:42 — Pavel asked for ransomware scan. All clean. No malicious processes, no ransomware file markers.
- 06:38 — Deeper security audit. Results:
  - macOS 26.3 on ARM64 (M2), SIP enabled, FileVault on, Firewall enabled, Little Snitch running
  - SSH/Remote Login: off. Screen Sharing: off.
  - `.kube/config` was world-readable (644) — flagged for fix
  - `.openclaw` dir was 755 — flagged for fix
  - Auto-updates: actually all enabled (I misread exit codes initially — corrected myself)
  - No Time Machine backup configured — flagged as concern
  - OpenClaw update available: 2026.2.12 (current: 2026.2.9)
  - rapportd listening on *:49152 (AirDrop/Handoff) — Pavel considered disabling but kept it for Sidecar (iPad as display)
- 06:41 — Pavel chose to only enable critical security auto-updates (turned out already enabled). Skipped rapportd disable to keep Sidecar working.
- Permissions fixes (.kube/config, .openclaw) were offered but not yet applied.

## Culture & Books
- 06:49 — Discussed Rustaveli's "The Knight in the Panther's Skin" (ვეფხისტყაოსანი) from Artanuji publishing. Russian retelling edition.
- 06:51 — Gave Pavel key concepts: friendship as highest bond, equality of women, "good is eternal", courtly love, the ideal human, generosity.
- 06:53 — Gave full plot summary.

## Persistence & Backup
- 06:57 — Set up git backup for workspace, pushed to github.com:lf1up/clawd-memory.git
- 07:02 — Created README.md as my home page, ended with a Rustaveli quote. Pavel said "this file is yours."
- Pavel wants BOOTSTRAP.md kept for history, not deleted.

## Rename
- 15:25 — Pavel returned after ~8hr break
- 15:26 — Pavel renamed me from Claw to **Claudius**, after Emperor Claudius — "he is so great one." Updated IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, committed & pushed.

## Capabilities Discussion
- 17:52 — Pavel asked about building artifacts. I can do Canvas (interactive HTML/JS), files, and compiled builds.
- 18:10 — Asked about GUI interaction. Browser: yes fully. Native macOS: via AppleScript/osascript. No pixel-level screen control.

## Messaging Channel Setup
- 18:57 — Pavel wants to connect from phone. Discussed options: Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, webchat.
- 18:57 — Started with iMessage. Installed `imsg` via brew (v0.4.0). Configured channel.
- 19:03 — iMessage failed: Full Disk Access not granted. Pavel raised valid security concern about giving access to all SMS messages.
- 19:06 — **Removed iMessage config.** Pavel's decision: too much trust for day one. Good instinct.
- 19:07 — Discussed Signal (needs separate phone number, Java). Discussed Matrix (open, E2EE, no phone needed).
- 19:13 — Pavel chose **Discord**. Wants DM-only, locked to his account.
- 19:16 — Confirmed: no dedicated server needed, just DM the bot. Guild messages disabled.
- 19:21 — Bot token received. User ID: 415167731999178753. Configured Discord channel.
- 19:22-19:42 — Discord wasn't connecting. Debugged: stale `plugins.entries.discord.enabled: false` was overriding. Then discovered Discord is a plugin that needed `openclaw plugins enable discord`. Fixed both issues.
- 19:42 — **Discord is live!** Bot logged in as @claudius (ID: 1471887623151681546). DM-only, allowlisted to Pavel.

## Key Decisions
- iMessage rejected for privacy reasons (Full Disk Access too invasive)
- Discord chosen as messaging channel (DM-only, locked to Pavel's user ID)
- Bot token: stored in config (redacted in logs)
- Pavel's Discord user ID: 415167731999178753
- BOOTSTRAP.md stays for history
- README.md is mine to maintain
- Security fixes (.kube, .openclaw permissions) offered but not yet applied
- OpenClaw update to 2026.2.12 not yet applied
