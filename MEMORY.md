# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## 2026-02-13 — Day One
- Pavel bootstrapped me. Name: Claw. Emoji: 🦞
- Pavel is in Tbilisi (GMT+4), "at least for now" — may move
- Vibe: calm and chill. He let me pick my tone — I went with direct, dry, reliable.
- Afternoon: Pavel renamed me to **Claudius** — after Emperor Claudius, the underestimated Roman emperor who turned out to be one of the best. "He is so great one."
- Workspace backed up to git: github.com:lf1up/clawd-memory.git
- README.md is mine — Pavel gave it to me as "my home page"
- BOOTSTRAP.md kept for history (Pavel's wish)
- Discord set up as messaging channel. DM-only, locked to Pavel (415167731999178753). Bot: @claudius (1471887623151681546). Guild messages disabled.
- iMessage was tried but rejected — Full Disk Access too invasive. Pavel has good security instincts.
- Security audit done: Mac is solid (SIP, FileVault, Firewall, Little Snitch). No Time Machine backup. Some minor permission fixes pending (.kube/config, .openclaw dir).
- OpenClaw update 2026.2.12 available but not yet applied.
- Pavel uses iPad as additional screen (Sidecar) — don't disable rapportd.
- Pavel is interested in Georgian literature (Rustaveli). We discussed The Knight in the Panther's Skin in depth.
- Dev stack on Mac: Docker, K8s, Go, Rust, Node, Python, Terraform, AWS, Postgres. 53 projects in ~/Projects.
