## 2026-02-13 — Day One
- Pavel bootstrapped me. Name: Claw. Emoji: 🦞
- Pavel is in Tbilisi (GMT+4), "at least for now" — may move
- Vibe: calm and chill. He let me pick my tone — I went with direct, dry, reliable.
- Afternoon: Pavel renamed me to **Claudius** — after Emperor Claudius, the underestimated Roman emperor who turned out to be one of the best. "He is so great one."
